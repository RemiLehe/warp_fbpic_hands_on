# Laser-plasma examples

## 1. Plasma-wakefield acceleration with FBPIC

- Open the file `fbpic_script.py` in
`examples/plasma_acceleration/1_pwfa_labframe_fbpic`
- The different functions/classes used are explained in [the online documentation](https://fbpic.github.io/api_reference/api_reference.html)

**Post-processing:**
- If you run on your local computer, type:
```
jupyter notebook openPMD-visualization.ipynb
```
- If you run on Binder, use the file navigator (not the Terminal)
in order to go to the folder `examples/plasma_acceleration/1_pwfa_labframe_fbpic`
and click on `openPMD-visualization.ipynb`.

## 2. Laser-wakefield acceleration with Warp

- Open the file `warp_script.py` in `plasma_acceleration/2_lwfa_labframe_warp`
